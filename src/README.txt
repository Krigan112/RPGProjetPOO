This game is a school project that could be a real game in a few months.
For now, it works by entering a number in a list the game show, and by pressing enter to make a choice.
Please renember of your character name to load your game, or you will be forced to go search your
character's name in the game's saved files.
To go forward in the story, just press enter.
Be carefull to the choices you make! They can send you to death!
I hope you will enjoy this game, and I work on to make some graphics, and say goodbye to the console ^^
